Located on the largest island in the Seine, Île de la Cité beside, Île St-Louis, one must stand in line to gain entry inside to see the famous stained glass windows.

				<p>Closed Mon </p>
				<p>Opened in 1985 with a long renovation completed in 2014, this small museum is located in a large 17th century mansion house. Instead of death duties Picasso’s heirs gave the French state many of his works covering all periods of his career. A fabulous space, comfortable sized museum in the heart of Le Marais across the river. Not to be missed.</p>

				<p>Closed Tues </p>
				<p>Home to the Musée National d’Art Moderne this incredible 1970’s building designed by Richard Rogers &amp; Renzo Piano is an iconic &amp; very popular place in Paris. It looks like the building is inside out with its workings (pipes, water ducts, elevator) placed on the outside giving the escalator ride up to its 5 floors one of the best vantage points to see the city. The permanent museum collection includes works from the Fauves, Surrealists &amp; Cubists &amp; there is always a contemporary show worth seeing as well as the street performers in the surrounding piazza. The excellent restaurant on the top floor terrace, Georges, offers great views of Paris.</p>

			<div class="flexItem3">
				<p>The smaller of the islands in the centre of the old city, Île St-Louis was formerly 2 swampy areas of pasture land for cows. One side was called Île Notre-Dame which belonged to the church and the other was known as Île de Vache (the Isle of the Cows) thus the restaurant L’Ilot Vache nearby.</p>

				<p>In the early 17th century, Henry IV ordered the islands joined to create a residential area. The island was raised, the gully filled in and the bridge, Pont St - Louis was built which joins it to the Île de la Cite where Notre Dame Cathedral reigns. Artisans and shopkeepers flocked to the central street, Rue Saint - Louis en Île, whereas nobility chose the riverside plots where they built elegant “hotels" or mansions. During the reign of Louis XIV, these homes were deserted as the wealthy left Paris for Versailles. By the 19th century, the Île had become one of the poorest quarters in Paris.</p>

				<p>More recently the Rothschilds, former French president George Pompidou, Marie Curie, Helena Rubinstein and Hemingway among others (Chopin, Baudelaire) have lived or worked at various addresses on the Île all identified by plaques on the buildings.</p>

				<p>There is a quiet park at the eastern tip of the island near the Pont de Sully where one can watch the bateaux mouche (Parisian open tour boats) make their turn. At this end of the island one can’t miss the massive ongoing renovation of the elegant Hotel Lambert which was most previously the home of the Baron de Rothschild and earlier the great French writer and philosopher Voltaire. It is now owned by an Arab sheik. </p>

				<p>The St Louis church was designed by the Royal Versailles architect le Vau who worked on Hotel Lambert as well. The Baroque interior is richly decorated with gilding and marble.</p>

				<p>The village like atmosphere, narrow streets, historic townhouses, tree lined quais and old bridges of the Ile St - Louis attract many strollers in the spring and summer despite no metro/subway connection. One of the attractions is the <strong>famous Berthillon ice cream </strong> and sorbet made on the Ile. Still a family owned business from the 1920’s they were the first to make artisan sorbets flavored with lavender, foie gras, etc. </p>

				<p>In 1924 , the Island locals made an attempt to secede from Paris and France, and Île St- Louis passports were issued. Now the island is home to both old French families and discerning foreigners looking for old world charm, conformity of architecture and the solitude and beauty offered by the island locale.</p>

					<h5>BENOIT, 4eme</h5>
					<p>20, rue St Martin (very close to Pompidou Centre)</p>
			 		<p>01 42 72 45 68 </p>
					<p>Very elegant old school French restaurant (100 yrs old.) Beautifully appointed & superb French service. Serious cuisine by Alain Ducasse so expensive but worth a visit to experience the traditional French cuisine at its best. Fixed menu at lunch with the house Chablis offers good value. Michelin 1 star. Quiet so a good place to talk.</p>

					<h5>AU BOURGUIGNON du MARAIS, 4eme</h5>
					<p>52, rue Francois Miron</p>
					<p>01 48 87 15 40,</p>
					<p>Closed Sun &amp; Mon</p>
					<p>Perfect, casual cafe for lunch with excellent food in a quiet corner of the Marais. Classic French menu, honest food. No need to book, at least for lunch. </p>

					<h5>CLAUDE COLLIOT, 4eme</h5>
					<p>40, rue des Blancs </p>
					<p>01 42 71 55 45 </p>
					<p>My new favourite. Small modern, quiet atmosphere. Unbelievable food prepared in a fresh way. Beautiful dishes. The pigeon &amp; cappuccino potatoes were unforgettable. The dessert composed of layers of salt frosted meringue, creamy marscapone with lichee sorbet in between was so interesting for its mix of flavours &amp; textures. The sea salt used was the salt “frost” from the salt flats in Gironde, Brittany - who knew salt frost existed.</p>

					<h5>CHEZ MADEMOISELLE, 4eme</h5>
					<p>16, rue Charlemagne (Village Saint Paul)</p>
					<p>01 42 72 14 16, Closed Mon</p>
					<p>Casual cafe/restaurant with charming young staff, very old elevator to the cave, manually operated in restaurant. Good food reasonably priced. We had the best buffalo mozzarella ball starter &amp; superb trio de pots de creme for dessert.</p>

					<h5>CRU, 4eme </h5>
					<p>Village Saint Paul, 7, rue Charlemagne</p>
					<p>01 40 27 81 84</p>
					<p>Closed Sun dinner &amp; Mon</p>
					<p>Tiny restaurant tucked away in a square full of artisan shops. Quiet in the heart of the city with a lovely terrace. If you feel like a light lunch full of fresh vegetables presented in a beautiful &amp; original way. Excellent ceviche &amp; fish.</p>
				</div> 

				<div class="flexItem3 restaurants">
					<h5>LE DOME DU MARAIS, 4eme</h5>
					<p>53, Bis rue des Francs Bourgeois</p>
					<p>01 42 74 54 17</p>
					<p>Gorgeous space in the middle of the Marais behind an austere 18 century facade includes a winter garden terrace cafe with birds &amp; a glamorous mirrored black/white dining room under a spectacular dome. Same menu for both spaces of good contemporary dishes (quinoa, scallops with artichoke mash) served by cool French staff. Height of the ceilings reminded me of the grandeur of some NYC restaurants with French clientele. Very good wine list. Even if you are not planning to go if you are in the area it’s worth visiting just to see the decor.</p>

					<h5>L’ENOTECA, 4eme </h5>
					<p>25, rue Charles V </p>
					<p>01 42 78 91 44</p>
					<p>Venetian with a huge wine list of Italian wines. Honest, simple “clean" food. Had a perfectly grilled tuna served on a red cabbage ragout. Nice change of cuisine from sometimes overworked French food. Friendly Italian staff. Charming old space.</p>

					<h5>L’OSTERIA, 4eme</h5>
					<p>10, rue Sevigne (just above Rue St Antoine in Marais)</p>
					<p>01 42 71 37 08, Closed Sun &amp; Mon </p>
					<p>Very unassuming, tiny Venetian restaurant with incredible Italian food. Had the best pesto ever &amp; freshest seafood plate. Not fancy but extremely good, reasonably priced. Mi- chelin states it is “Les plus authentiques de la capitale."</p>

					<h5>MON VIEILLE AMI, 4eme</h5>
					<p>69, rue Saint Louis en Ile</p>
					<p>01 40 46 01 35 </p>
					<p>Great food, best on the Île Saint-Louis apart from the grand tasting menu &amp; pomp of the restaurant Sargent Recruteur also on the Ile. Worth a visit although busy with tourists like all the restaurants on the Île.</p>

					<p>Closed Sun &amp; Mon </p>
					<p>These two share the same Michelin star chef &amp; have a similar feel given the very colorful abstract paintings &amp; decor. Ze Kitchen is bigger, more formal &amp; serious with the star officially while the menu at KGB is more limited but also superb. Creative fusion of French &amp; Asian cuisine beautifully presented. KGB offers a tasting menu of 3, 4 or 5 hors d’oeuvres. Both require a reservation &amp; small appetite. Perfect for lunch.</p>

					<h5>SEMILLA, 6eme</h5>
					<p>54, rue de Seine </p>
					<p>01 43 54 34 50 (Reservation required) </p>
					<p>Small, buzzy, noisy restaurant with excellent food. One can eat at the bar up front or at the back bar to watch the open kitchen or at the tiny tables. Casual vibe, interesting dishes
